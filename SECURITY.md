# Security policy. untrusted-read

## Posture

untrusted-read is provided as-is, with NO WARRANTY (see LICENSE). Use it as one
control among several, never as a sole guarantee.

If this is a security-oriented tool, the honest ceiling applies: it **reduces,
does not eliminate**, the risk it addresses. Behavioral rules are defense-in-depth
on top of a structural limit, and the structural limit only holds if the host
environment actually enforces it (e.g. actually withholds the tools/permissions
the design assumes are withheld). State that assumption; do not let it read as a
promise the code can't keep.

## Validation status

<State plainly whether this tool's tests / red-team corpus have been RUN, and
link the results. An unrun corpus is disclosed here, in the open. never hidden
behind a "tested" claim. Disclosure does not transfer the duty; run it before
you rely on it.>

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately to https://github.com/justin-rhee. Please do not open a public issue for a
suspected vulnerability. give a reasonable window for a fix first.
